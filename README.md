## Features

- **Diverse Gameplay Mechanics**: Our Snake can eat up to **9 different types of fruit**, each with its own unique effect. Some fruits speed up the Snake, while others might slow it down or increase its size variably.
- **Realistic Snake Movement**: Unlike traditional implementations that use multiple segments, our Snake consists of only **two images**: a head and a body. This minimalistic approach beautifully simulates fluid, realistic movement.
- **Boundary Gameplay**: There are no teleporting edges in this game. If you hit the boundary, it's game over, adding an extra layer of challenge.
- **Global High Scores**: Compete with players around the world with high scores hosted on **Firebase**, encouraging continuous play and competition.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Vue 3 (Composition API) + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Performance Optimization**: Vite
- **Backend**: Firebase (for global high scores)

Join the fun and test your reflexes and strategy with our modernized version of Snake. Whether youâ€™re looking to kill time or aiming to top the global leaderboards, this game promises not to disappoint.
